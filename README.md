# Problem Statement
We're choosing the Fix the Docs: Smarter, Faster Maintainable Documentation for Real World by iFast because:

- Customers face difficulties placing orders as they need to queue. 

- Vendors struggle to manage orders manually using receipt printers. 

- Owners find it difficult to perform analysis as most records are in hard copy, making forecasting demand and stock challenging. 

- A cashless payment solution is needed to meet modern customer preferences. 

- There is no integrated ecosystem, causing inefficiency in overall business operations.
